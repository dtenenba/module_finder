Description
===========
Check is a unit testing framework for C. It features a simple interface for
defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer. Tests are
run in a separate address space, so both assertion failures and code errors
that cause segmentation faults or other signals can be caught. Test results
are reportable in the following: Subunit, TAP, XML, and a generic logging
format.
